In the twelfth part of the course we will introduce type parameters and you will learn what ArrayList<String>; actually means. 
You will learn to implement classes that use type parameters. You will get to understand how ArrayList and HashMap are implemented, 
and you will implement your own versions as well. You will learn how to create random numbers, and practice using some Java tools to create random numbers. 
You will learn how multidimensional data can be presented, and how to use multidimensional arrays.
